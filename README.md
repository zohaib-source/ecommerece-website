üõçÔ∏è E-commerce Frontend UI (HTML & CSS Only)

This repository contains the static frontend layoutfor an e-commerce website, built purely with **HTML and CSS**.

*Important Note:* This is a **non-functional demo**. It is intended to showcase design and structure only. There is **no JavaScript**, and therefore no actual shopping cart, checkout process, search functionality, or backend integration. All links and buttons are visual placeholders.

‚ú® Features
Responsive Design:** Styled using modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid) to ensure the layout looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
Standard E-commerce Pages:** Includes layouts for a main product listing/homepage, product detail view, and navigation.
Clean Code:** Focuses on semantic HTML5 structure and well-organized CSS3 styling.
